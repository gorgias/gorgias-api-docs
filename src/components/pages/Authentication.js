            <h1> Authentication </h1>
            <p>
                There is several ways to authenticate your requests to the Gorgias API.
            </p>

            <h3>API Key authentication</h3>
            <p>
                The recommended method of authentication for using the API is to use API keys. You can find your account&#39;s API keys on your Gorgias helpdesk, in <Code light inline>Settings > API Keys</Code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using an API Key for authentication is as easy as using Basic authentication: actually, it uses the same process (HTTP Basic authentication), but with your email as username, and the API Key as password:
            </p>
            <Code light>
              Authorization: Basic YWRtaW5AZ29yZ2lhcy5pbzphZG1pbg==
            </Code>
            <p>
                with <Code light inline>YWRtaW5AZ29yZ2lhcy5pbzphZG1pbg==</Code> being the string <Code light inline>email:apikey</Code> encoded in base64.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <Code light inline>Settings > API Keys</Code>, you can manage your API Keys,
                e.g. create new API Keys or delete existing ones. We really encourage you to delete any API Key
                you think may have been compromised, and to replace them frequently.
                {/*
                Moreover, you can assign "rights" to your key: only assign what you need, as it would really
                mitigate the eventual consequences of a compromised API Key.
                */}
            </p>

            <h3>Basic authentication</h3>
            <p>
                You can authenticate to Gorgias using regular HTTP Basic authentication, by including the
                <Code light inline>Authorization</Code> header in your request:
            </p>
            <Code light>
                Authorization: Basic YWRtaW5AZ29yZ2lhcy5pbzphZG1pbg==
            </Code>
            <p>
                with <Code light inline>YWRtaW5AZ29yZ2lhcy5pbzphZG1pbg==</Code> being the string <Code light inline>username:password</Code> encoded in base64. Though, this method is not recommended and should never be used, as when changing your password you would need to update authentication in your applications as well.
